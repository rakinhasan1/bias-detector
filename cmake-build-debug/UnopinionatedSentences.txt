House Republicans plan to call Hunter Biden, the Ukraine whistleblower and a range of other witnesses to testify in the upcoming public Trump impeachment hearings, according to a witness list obtained exclusively by Fox News
It is unclear, at this point, how many of the Republicans’ proposed witnesses will be approved by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and the Democrats, because the newly-approved resolution governing the impeachment inquiry give the approval power to the chairman and the members of the majority
The realization came only over time to the professionals responsible for Ukraine
At the top of Republicans’ list is former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, who has emerged as a central figure in the Ukraine controversy due to his business dealings

At the time, the former vice president was running U.S.-Ukraine policy under former President Barack Obama
On Saturday, Schiff said in a statement that the Intelligence Committee was evaluating the GOP request and would "give due consideration to witnesses within the scope of the impeachment inquiry, as voted on by the House."
This process still gives Democrats final say over witnesses
Schiff, who is leading much of the impeachment inquiry, announced Wednesday that his committee would hold its first open hearings next week, featuring current and former officials with knowledge of the Ukraine controversy
