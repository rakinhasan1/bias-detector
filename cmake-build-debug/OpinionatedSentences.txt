Transcripts depict Trump as fickle, susceptible to flattery and prone to grudges
How Democrats are prepping for make-or-break public impeachment testimony
The absence of phone etiquette is hardly a surprise for a President not known for his manners
The aide told CNN that the preparations are a "much bigger operation" and that the "coordination is on a whole other level" compared to what transpired before former special counsel Robert Mueller came to Capitol Hill to testify about his Russia investigation
How Michael Bloomberg could shake up twenty twenty race
To provide transparency to your otherwise opaque and unfair process, and after consultation with [House Oversight Committee] Ranking Member Jim Jordan and [House Foreign Affairs Committee] Ranking Member Michael McCaul, the American people deserve to hear from the following witnesses in an open setting
The impeachment inquiry began when a whistleblower reported that Trump had pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into the Biden family’s dealings in Ukraine—specifically, why former Vice President Joe Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter held a lucrative role on the board, bringing in a reported fifty thousand per month
Republicans also plan to call the younger Biden's former long-time business partner, Devon Archer, who also sat on the board of Burisma. Republicans claim Archer can help the public to understand "the nature and extent of Ukraine's pervasive corruption information that bears directly on President Trump's longstanding and deeply-held skepticism of the country
KSI and Logan Paul are not most professional boxers
This inquiry is not, and will not serve, however, as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or twenty sixteen that the President pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit, or to facilitate the President’s effort to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm,” he said
Because the Democrats’ resolution unfairly restricts Minority rights and because you have provided no information about which witnesses you may invite to testify at future hearings not yet scheduled, we reserve our right to request additional witnesses, if necessary, as you announce additional hearings," he added. "Your failure to fulfill Minority witness requests shall constitute evidence of your denial of fundamental fairness and due process

Notes from the whistleblower complaint said the opposite, citing a White House official who listened in to the phone call and described it as "crazy" and "frightening" and was "visibly shaken
I was concerned by the call," said Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the director of European affairs at the National Security Council
Trump continues to defend his call with Zelenskiy as "perfect," and has made negative comments about the inquiry, calling it a "hoax
Anonymous book describes volatile, incompetent Trump
The book describes racist and misogynist behind-the-scenes statements by Trump and says he "stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement late Thursday saying, "The coward who wrote this book didn't put their names on it because it is nothing but lies."
"A Warning" was written by the official who wrote an essay, published last year in The New York Times, alleging that numerous people in the government were resisting the "misguided impulses" of Trump
They only want to really use radical socialism and they want to open your borders
Bolton is a neocon true believer in a strong executive, so it makes sense he wouldn't, on his own, want to cross a White House claim of executive privilege and cooperate with House impeachment investigators
And it's a good bet that someone with Bolton's history of supporting executive power won't think President Donald Trump acted inappropriately even if he's willing to help take down others in the administration
